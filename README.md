You are given a list with dates find the mean day of the given list.

**Explanation**:

Given that the range of day values are 1-7 while Monday = 1 and Sunday = 7 

**Find the "Meanest Day" of the list** 
**"Meanest Day" is the sum of values of all the days divided by total number of days**

hence Meanest day = 4+4+4 // 3 ---> 4 (Thursday)
```
